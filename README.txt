Console Board Game
This is a C# console-based board game for 4 players. Each player has 4 pieces that start from the corners of a 10x10 2D board. Players roll a dice to move their pieces, and the objective is to move all pieces to the center of the board. If a piece lands on an occupied position, the other piece is sent back to its starting position.

Rules:
-The game is played by 4 players.
-Each player has 4 pieces.
-Pieces start in the "home" position (corners of the board).
-Players take turns rolling a dice.
-A roll of 6 allows a piece to move from home to the starting position.
-Players move their pieces based on the dice roll in a clockwise direction, following a spiral path towards the center.
-If a piece lands on an occupied position, the occupying piece is sent back to its home.
-Once a piece reaches the center, it is safe and cannot be sent back home.
-The first player to move all 4 pieces to the center wins.
